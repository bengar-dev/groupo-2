**0. Config**

Before launch or build app, you have to config .env file in **back-api** folder

```ts
DEV_ENV="http://XXX"
API_PORT=8080
TOKEN_KEY="XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
DATABASE_URL="mongodb+srv://USERNAME:PASSWORD@YOURSERVER.mongodb.net/YOURCOLLECTIONAME"
```

**1. Using docker**

On root folder launch : ```npm run reset```
*This will build and launch application.*

If you have already build app you can launch : ```npm run restart```
*This will only launch application.*

**2. Without docker**

This way is not recommended because it might have some difference between dependencies and compatibilities.
